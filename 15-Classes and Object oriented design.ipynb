    "Object-oriented programming (or OOP) refers to a programming paradigm that’s based on the concept of, well, objects. In this paradigm, objects can contain both data and code. These objects can also have attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in short, objects have properties and behaviors. Let’s think of an object representing a person, for example. The person has many different properties, such as a name, age, hair color. They can also do things, such as walk or greet people. Object-oriented programming models real-world entities in the form of organized code that can have properties (via attributes) and can do things (via methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is focused on the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**: The idea behind encapsulation is that all properties and methods of an object are kept private and safe from being inherited by another object. This allows you to define both public and private methods and attributes. Public methods can be used by people using your program, while private methods cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction**: Behind the concept of abstraction is the concept of encapsulation. Abstraction allows you to expose only high-level mechanisms for doing certain things while hiding away (or “abstracting”) the complex mechanisms behind it. For example, your car abstracts all the mechanics behind turning your car on by pressing a button or turning a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows you to create similar objects that maintain a base number of properties (attributes) and abilities (methods). This allows you to create one type of object that can be used as a base for many other objects without needing to repeat your code. For example, the base of a car can be used to create objects such as trucks, SUVs, and camper vans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polymorphism**: The concept of polymorphism builds on the concept of inheritance. While it can be helpful to define child objects, these child objects may operate slightly differently. Polymorphism allows you to define a child object but create and use its own methods. Following, the example of cars and trucks, the method to turn on a truck may be slightly different from turning on a car."
